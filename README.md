# Rchain-Rholang
IsPrime created in Rholang

Rholang is a concurrent programming language leveraging message passing through the use of channels/names. It is modeled after the
Rho-Calculus discovered by Greg Meredith (RChain lead) in 2005 and implemented using the hasing method most prominently found in 
Bitcoin (2008), dubbed 'The Blockchain'. Throough formulating a blockchain based on Rho-Calculus, end-users are granted the ability to
build ports and channels to interact with their codebase as well as ensuring that code is robust along with being correct-by-construction.
